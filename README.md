# Nutritional Therapy


## What I did

- Multi-language
- Full TypeScript
- Apollo (using mock local data)
- Basic unit test
- Clean Code
- Lottie
- Basic Es-lint

## What I didn't have the time

- Add e2e testing
- Add local DB for offline mode
  (I wanna add Realm, and using zustand getting the data from the DB or apollo)
- Add a Native component
- More RN animation
  (I wanna add some animation to the header on Details, also add an extra button and animate both on scroll)


I tried to replicate the Home screen picture showing at the Play Store, after download it I saw was different. I will upload a video
to show the end state
